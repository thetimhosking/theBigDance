# Scenarios

The following scenarios describe only some of the typical features and uses of the system. They do not aim to cover all the possibilities, but should be used as stories of how the system might be used. Additional scenarios can be added if certain features are not described. The system will not be limited to supporting the following scenarios. For example, the scenario about the individual golfer is just one story of how an individual sports competitor might interact with the system. The same kind of features might also apply to cycling, swimming, weightlifting, fishing, etc.

## Individual Golfer

Walter plays golf regularly against his mates, and occasionally plays in the Saturday morning competition at his local golf club where he is a member. Walter likes to play at other clubs as well. He and his mates travel to Ireland every year on a tour to play their favourite links and he wants to keep a good record of his performances at all those courses. His local club records his results in the Saturday morning comp, however SportsRecordz means he is able to record his scores at all courses he plays in one app and share it with his mates. When he plays in the organised comp the club can record his score in this system. When Walter plays at another course he can enter his score and then another member of the club or another user of SportRecordz can confirm his score. The system keeps a record of who entered and who confirmed the score to establish the reliability of Walter’s scores. Walter’s handicap can be recorded and tracked over time. The advantage of this system is that the player can record games outside of competitions and across more than one course.

Walter can see his ranking against other players by their scores at the same courses and by other factors, such as, geographic area, age, sex, etc.

Walter can post photos related to a game or event and push these to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.

Friends of Walter can follow him and see his scores as well as get progress posted to them. For example, when he scores a hole in one he can record this and push it out to all his mates who aren’t there with him at the time.

## Local Indoor Soccer Team

A group of mates form their own indoor soccer team, called the Macarthur Maidens, which they enter into various competitions at different venues. The team’s identity and record of performances persists regardless of competitions in which the team is entered. Over the course of a few seasons, they join several competitions as the Macarthur Maidens. The system is able to keep a record of their performances in different competitions and provide a ranking against teams in the same or similar competitions. The same team might join competitions for other sports as well. There is nothing stopping the Macarthur Maidens playing indoor soccer as well as mixed netball.

The system can be used to notify teammates of upcoming games, training sessions, etc. The system records their achievements across competitions and over any period of time, giving them their own identity.

Individuals looking for a game can register and make themselves available in a geographic location and times of competition games so that teams looking for additional players can contact them. Their previous record as a player in another location or in other teams builds their profile so that other teams can recruit them. When Macarthur Maidens are short a player they can do a quick search and see who is available and offer them a spot on their team sheet for the one game via this app or to be part of the team indefinitely. 

Teams registered like this can be targeted by competitions through their advertising to join a competition. For example, the Macarthur Sports Complex can send all the individuals in the Macarthur Maidens an invitation to sign up for their new weights program.

## New Local Competition Starts

A new aerobics competition starts at a local sports centre. The sports centre wants to put the dates and times for competition out and advertise it to all people in a geographic area that are interested in aerobics. People can register for events. Competitors who register can be notified of changes in venue and timetables of events. The sports centre can record results of the competition, which are included in the profiles of competitors. 

## Major Competition

The Macarthur District Cricket Association (MDCA) wants to use the system instead of maintaining their own fixtures, results, etc. They set up each team, the venues for games, players registering for the competition and recording of results. 

When it rains and a game is delayed or cancelled, or shifted to another venue, the MCDA can post this information so that all players can be notified of the change, with notifications pushed out via email, Faceboook, Twitter, etc.

Progressive scores can be posted so that spectators and followers can watch for progress.

## Soccer Supporter or Spectator

Mitchell is a spectator with friends playing in the local soccer competition and he turns up at a game when it is already started. He is at a large sporting facility and there are a number of games on and he isn’t sure if he has the right game, or where his mates are playing. Mitchell checks into the game by using his location, and confirms that this is the game he wants to watch. He can see the teams involved, who is playing and the current score.
Family Supporter
Grandpa Joe wants to follow his grandson Charlie’s progress and feats at Little Athletics. He is able to connect to Charlie’s profile (follow Charlie), similar to being added as a friend in Facebook. This may require some features to allow Charlie’s profile to be monitored or managed by his parents. Then, when Charlie (or his parents) post his results from training or a competition, Grandpa Joe sees the results and can comment.

## Little Athletics to Professional Sports

Indiana participates in little athletics and her parents are able to record her performances and compare against other children by their age, geographic region, sex, and other parameters. Indiana's grandparents, aunts and uncles can view her results and make comments. Indianna or her parents are able to maintain a record over time of all her achievements and this goes to building her profile as an athlete to be used by recruiters, etc. When Indianna breaks the Little Athletics high jump record for her age, the system realises this has happened and advertises it to those involved in Little Athletics.

When Indiana becomes a teenager she decides that she wants to play netball instead and over time she plays for her school as well as in an organised Saturday morning competition. Her results in all those teams are recorded.

When Indiana is 19 she is approached to join a local Women’s AFL team and she decides to switch in the hope that she can become a professional sportsperson. Her entire record of sporting achievements from Little Athletics through to netball competitions are recorded. The AFL recruiters pay to see this information and Indiana has allowed this information to be available. They can she her commitment and her results over a long time.

## School

Macarthur High School offers a number of sports and sporting related activities to its pupils. The school can enter the details of the competitions and grades of competition (e.g. age grades) that it runs. Pupils at the school can see what teams they are in, when they are playing and where. The school can update scores, fixtures, etc. Parents can see when games are being played and where.
